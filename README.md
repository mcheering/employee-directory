# React Employee Directory

## Deployed Application: 

## API used:
* randomuser.me 

## Overview

This project was an opportunity to dive into the React framework and use a new API that allowed me to explore state, using many components that are reusable .  

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
